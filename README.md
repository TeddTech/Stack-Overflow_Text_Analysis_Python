### Overview

The `SOresponse` package is used for text analysis of Stack Overflow responses. There are both R and Python versions for this package. This package will include 3 functions: `web_page()` `word_count()` `word_mode()`

* `web_page()`: Loads Stack Overflow response webpage.

* `word_count()`: Counts the total number of words on webpage.

* `word_mode()`: Returns the most common word on webpage.

Currently, there are no Python or R software packages that have the same/similar functionality.
